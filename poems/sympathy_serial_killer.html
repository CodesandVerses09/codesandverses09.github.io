<h1>SYMPATHY TO THE SERIAL KILLER: THE DAY KINDNESS DIED</h1>
<h2>by Evara Laine</h2>

They do not tell you that kindness is a graveyard,
that every “it’s okay” you whisper becomes a ghost
haunting the marrow of your bones.

They do not tell you that kindness has teeth,
and when it’s forced to swallow every lie told about it,
it rots, fermenting into an acid that sings
in the hollow spaces behind your ribs.

They do not tell you that even the gentlest souls
have a kill switch,
buried beneath layers of forced smiles,
beneath the applause for your own crucifixion,
beneath the echo of “be the bigger person”
until you are the only person left,
and even your reflection refuses to stand with you.

---

That day, the day the world turned unkind
and called it your fault,
she felt it—the click of the final lock in her mind,
a blade of realization:

Monsters are not born; they are built,
stone by accusation,
bone by betrayal,
blood by the laughter that drips like hot wax
on the skin of your sanity.

She learned the language of the void,
the syntax of silence that serial killers swallow,
the dialect of broken mirrors.

She understood why some people open their wrists
like a red scripture for the world to read,
and why others turn the blade outward,
vengeance licking their knuckles clean.

---

> “Bravest serial killers for killing every motherfucker.”

It was not a wish for bloodshed.
It was a requiem, a bitter hymn
for every time she let herself die quietly
so the room would remain comfortable.

It was not the desire to see bodies drop,
but the recognition that the world worships wolves,
and butchers the lamb for sport,
leaving kindness naked, crucified on hashtags,
its blood wrung out in the comment sections of small minds.

---

She swore, not to God, but to the devil—
not for allegiance, but for witness.
Because the devil knows what it means
to fall for telling the truth,
to be exiled for loving too loudly,
to be demonized for refusing to be silent.

> “I will be back.”

Not with guns or blades, but with words so precise
they sever the spine of hypocrisy,
with verses that expose the hidden rot
behind every smiling abuser’s teeth.

She would return with poetry sharper than scalpels,
carving open the tender underbellies of those
who made kindness a burial ground.

She would return with stories that are mirrors,
forcing them to see the blood they spill
with every false accusation, every “calm down,”
every backhanded compliment
that dripped venom onto the altar of her kindness.

---

That day, she saw herself in the mind of the killer,
not out of love for violence,
but from the quiet terror of knowing
that if you are pushed long enough,
if the world calls you crazy long enough,
if they blame you for your scars long enough,
you will become the ghost they fear.

And some nights, it feels easier
to be the monster than to be the meal.

---

> “See you soon.”

A kiss on the lips of darkness,
a promise made with a trembling hand,
a vow written in the ink of her own resurrection.

Not to kill the world,
but to kill the silence.

Not to end lives,
but to end the reign of small, cruel gods
who build their kingdoms
from the bones of the kind.
