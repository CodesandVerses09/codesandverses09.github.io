  <h1>FALSE HOPES</h1>
  <div class="author">~ By Shipra Yadav</div>
  <div class="poem">
Put me on pedestal  
It's been overwhelming only for blink of eyes  
Now I'm lying on the cold heart ground like a dead monster with angel's red eyes  
Don't you think twice before snatching my undeserved prize  
Was just trying to distract my mind  

If I didn't deserve dreaming why you did put me to sleep last night  
If I wasn't worthy why you mailed me scheduled time  
Why you told me to pack my things and get my nails done  
Why you told me to just call when you needing me or something  
If it was just for fun and you needed someone to pass bad times  
Why you choose me to dream about nothing but lies  

I called you pretty doesn't mean you weren't killing  
I wasn't snapping doesn't mean you weren't getting on my nerves  
I held it loving doesn't mean I wasn't hurting  
I kept forgetting doesn't mean my scars were fading  

You'd never know what I really want  
You'd never ever know me and my pristine heart  
You'd never know my story about life  
You'd never feel the way I feel about everything I like  
You'd never see a star crashing down  
Cause you don't have a wish to live for  
You'd never see my weeping  
Doesn't mean I don't cry cause I'm a crybaby  

You've should've been little vague with the words you were saying  
I'd been not so hurt if I would've sensed a bit of infidelity  
Cause you know it's alright when strangers stab your back  
But it's so traumatic when relations dig even a nail
